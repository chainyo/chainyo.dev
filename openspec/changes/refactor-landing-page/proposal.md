# Change: Refactor landing page narrative and structure

## Why
The current homepage centers on a "one SaaS per month" narrative that no longer reflects the founder-led B2B focus. The site should communicate credibility, focus, and a clear way to reach out.

## What Changes
- Replace hero messaging with founder-led AI engineering positioning and B2B focus
- Introduce clear sections for current focus, products, writing (blog placeholder), and contact
- Rework project content to emphasize shipped products over a monthly streak
- Update SEO and social metadata to match the new positioning
- Refresh layout and visual emphasis for clarity and credibility

## Impact
- Affected specs: present-homepage (new)
- Affected code: `src/routes/+page.svelte`
